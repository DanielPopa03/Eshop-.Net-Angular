An ecomerce website build with .NET + Angular to resemble sites like 'Amazon' and bassically it is more like a marketplace for different companies. It has JWT authentification and automatic self sign out when the token expires. A nice feature is the forgot password which was implemented with an external email service (Mail jet) for which I neeeded to use an organization email(I used an old school email). <img width="1895" height="895" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-12 191135" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0766bee1-bb58-411d-b6ad-33f79e9f269a" /> <img width="1341" height="426" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-12 191239" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/642981f4-63a4-4d20-8858-54229f84d7c5" /> <img width="717" height="447" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-12 191221" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e20576c2-b7ab-4662-8a3b-838bacc62e06" /> <img width="811" height="394" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-12 191208" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2c5b4c0-f89d-4065-bbcd-f66e4ae05699" /> There are 3 types of users: the client, the moderator(has acces to the moderator tab) and the admin(has acces to the admin and moderator tab). The moderators are the administrators of different companies, like a user can be a moderator to none or many companies <img width="1868" height="890" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-12 191344" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/047ce710-c534-4f17-8ba6-cd01f1ddf9f9" /> (moderator tab) <img width="1319" height="893" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-12 191407" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b635a32-afef-4c75-b043-3fe92b3b63cc" /> (add product tab-> each product can have multiple images and each images is store in the wwwroot and use as a link) Each Product is part of a category and each category has a number of attributes, the moderator can choose which attributes fit the product and fill them in  for the product. Example Flat Screen Tv is part of Electronics which has the attributes Screen and Batery but of course the moderator will only fill in the  Screen one. Each attributes has a type for example "dropdown" in order that the UI knows how to interpret it. <img width="580" height="853" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1a2685b-4766-480c-8138-40459bf0dd7b" />(filters) The admin adds companies and their moderators and also adds categories and their attributes. <img width="1501" height="876" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-12 191427" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/305e1dd8-5bd8-421d-a967-cb387c0f414c" /> The product page is where you can see and search and filter the product you are in the search of,  <img width="1852" height="879" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-12 192252" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c86b46c-94f0-466a-92c1-7c66d28ec226" /> <img width="1852" height="893" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-12 192236" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/507c1256-59e5-449c-afb3-ab1e934d1048" /> After deciding which product to buy you click on it and you can see its description, if it is in stock or not and see its reviews <img width="1729" height="904" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-12 195619" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/985adb40-4db5-4651-b28a-63c8f0ad6e34" /> <img width="1558" height="916" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-12 195532" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21a4a418-299f-447a-95aa-cd359b15f5f8" />
